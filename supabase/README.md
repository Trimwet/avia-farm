# Supabase Backend — MediQ

This folder contains the Supabase project configuration for MediQ.
It manages the database schema, edge functions, and local development setup.

**Project ref:** `snvdwamqjreuhtyrrrlg`
**Project URL:** https://snvdwamqjreuhtyrrrlg.supabase.co

## Local Development

```bash
# Start local Supabase stack (Postgres, Auth, Studio, etc.)
supabase start

# Stop local stack
supabase stop

# Reset database (re-run migrations + seed)
supabase db reset
```

## Linking to Remote

```bash
# 1. Log in to Supabase (opens browser — one-time)
supabase login

# 2. Link to the MediQ project
supabase link --project-ref snvdwamqjreuhtyrrrlg
```

## Schema Management

```bash
# Push local migrations to remote
supabase db push

# Pull remote schema as a new migration
supabase db pull

# Create a new migration
supabase migration new <name>
```

## Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy a single function
supabase functions deploy <function-name>

# Serve functions locally (part of supabase start)
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Never commit `.env` files.** They are gitignored.

## Relationship to avia-farm-admin

The admin dashboard (`avia-farm-admin/`) currently runs on mock repositories
(`avia-farm-admin/src/data/mock/`). When this backend is ready, the mock
implementations will be swapped for Supabase-backed ones — the repository
interfaces in `avia-farm-admin/src/data/repos.ts` remain unchanged.

## RPCs

- **`book_appointment(name, email, phone, scheduled_for, doctor_id?, reason?)` → uuid**
  Anonymous/self-service booking entry point. Upserts patient (lowercased email),
  resolves doctor name from `doctors` table, inserts appointment with status locked
  to `pending`. Granted to `anon` and `authenticated`.
- **`mark_notification_read(notification_id)`** — marks one notification as read for the
  calling user. Granted to `authenticated`.
- **`mark_all_notifications_read()`** — marks all unread notifications as read.
  Granted to `authenticated`.

## Bootstrap First Admin

After the first user signs up, promote them to admin via the Dashboard SQL Editor:

```sql
UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'admin'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = '<admin-email>' LIMIT 1);
```
